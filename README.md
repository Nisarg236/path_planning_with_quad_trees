# path_planning_with_quad_trees
This repository converts 2D occupancy grid into a quad tree and implements planning algorithms for mobile robots using quad tree. Planning works much faster on these because each square represents an area with free space and these neighbouring squares are already connected in a graph. This allows for planning paths in large maps.
